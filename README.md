# Assign2
Instructions

Implement classes that run certain geometric calculations
Implement the classes Circle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square.
Implement the method printAreaAndPerimeter in the Test class that prints the area and
the perimeter of the passed GeometricObject.

In the Test class, create an array of GeometricObject of size 5
a. The first element should be assigned to a Circle object: new Circle(5,5,5).
b. The second element should be assigned to an EquilateralTriangle object: new
EquilateralTriangle(5).
c. The third element should be assigned to a Triangle object: new Triangle(5,5,5).
d. The fourth element should be assigned to a Rectangle object: new Rectangle(5,5).
e. The fifth element should be assigned to a Square object: new Square(5).

Pass each element in the array to printAreaAndPerimeter.
